# Java-Linear-Algebra
### Concepts from Linear Algebra implemented in Java.
I am studying both Linear Algebra and Java in school this semester (Spring 2018). I decided to combine the two by making some Java classes to "check" my homework for me. This project has various classes and methods to solve common problemns in linear algebra. It can model matrices, augmented matrices, square matrices, and column vectors. The project can reduce augmented matrices, find the inverse of square matrices, and calculate whether or not a set of vectors are linearly independent. I also provide many other useful methods. Look at example.java for examples of how to use this project and what it is capable of.
