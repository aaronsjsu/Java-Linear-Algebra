# Java-Linear-Algebra
I am currently studying both Linear Algebra and Java in school. I decided to combine the two by making some Java classes to "check" my homework for me. Currently, the main thing this project can do is it can take an augmented matrix (modeled by a 2d array) and reduce it into reduced row echelon form using Gauss-Jordan Elimination. In the future, I plan to add the capability to multiply vectors and matrices, as well as to solve problems using vector-parametric form.
