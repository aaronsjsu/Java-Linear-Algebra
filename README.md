# Java-Linear-Algebra
### Concepts from Linear Algebra implemented in Java.
I am currently studying both Linear Algebra and Java in school. I decided to combine the two by making some Java classes to "check" my homework for me. Currently, the substantial thing this project can do is it can take an augmented matrix (modeled by a 2d array) and reduce it into reduced row echelon form using Gauss-Jordan Elimination. The project can also model column vectors and square matrices. I also provide many other useful methods. Look at Example.java for examples of how to use this project.
